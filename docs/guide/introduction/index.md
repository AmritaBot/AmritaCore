# Project Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

### 1.1.1 What is AmritaCore?

AmritaCore is the intelligent agent core module of Proj.Amrita, serving as the primary logical or control component of the project. It provides a comprehensive and extensible framework for developing AI-powered agents with advanced capabilities such as event-driven architecture, tool integration, and sophisticated memory management.

AmritaCore is designed to simplify the creation and deployment of intelligent agents, abstracting away the complexities of communication protocols, context management, and external service integration. It offers developers a clean API to focus on agent logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

### 1.1.2 Project Background and Mission

The mission of AmritaCore is to democratize the development of intelligent agents by providing a powerful yet accessible framework. As AI applications grow increasingly complex, there's a need for standardized approaches to handle:

- Event-driven interactions
- Tool integration
- Context and memory management
- Security considerations
- Multi-modal inputs and outputs

AmritaCore addresses these challenges with a modular architecture that allows for both simple and sophisticated implementations.

### 1.1.3 Core Value Propositions

- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various use cases from simple chatbots to complex decision-making systems
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying loads with appropriate context management
- **Security**: Built-in mechanisms for secure sessions and prompt injection protection
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with custom tools and event handlers
- **Portability**: Vendor-agnostic approach allowing deployment across different platforms
