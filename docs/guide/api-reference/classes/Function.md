# Function

The Function class represents a callable function in the tool system.

## Properties

- `arguments` (str): Arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.
- `name` (str): Name of the function to call.

## Description

The Function class inherits from BaseModel and is used to represent functions that can be called by the AI model. It stores the function name and arguments passed to the function, primarily used in tool calling scenarios.
