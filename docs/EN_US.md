> **Documentation under construction** - More detailed content coming soon!

## Project Aim

AmritaCore aims to provide a flexible, extensible foundation for building AI-powered agents that can interact intelligently with users and systems. The core is designed to be modular, allowing developers to easily integrate different LLM providers, customize agent behaviors, and extend functionality through tools and plugins.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight & Modular Design**: Focused on core agent functionality with minimal dependencies, enabling easy integration into various applications
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Supports creation of multiple specialized agents with different capabilities and personalities
- **Intelligent Context Management**: Automatic context summarization and memory management to maintain coherent long-running conversations
- **Event-Driven Extensibility**: Pluggable architecture allowing customization through event handlers and middleware
- **Tool Integration Framework**: Built-in support for external tools and function calling to extend agent capabilities
- **Content Safety System**: Integrated moderation mechanisms to ensure safe and appropriate responses
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Capable of processing both text and image inputs for richer interactions
- **Adaptive Response Generation**: Context-aware responses with configurable creativity and strictness levels
- **Session Management**: Robust session handling with metadata tracking and persistence
- **LLM Provider Agnostic**: Compatible with multiple LLM providers through adapter pattern (OpenAI, etc.)
