# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of our community, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicity, gender characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment in our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting different viewpoints, positions, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community rather than personal interests

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via official social media accounts, or serving as a designated representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible at [Mail](mailto:admin@suggar.top).

All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
