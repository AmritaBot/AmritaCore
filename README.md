AmritaCore is the intelligent agent core module of Proj.Amrita, serving as the primary logical or control component of the project. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for implementing AI agents with advanced capabilities.

## 🚀 What is AmritaCore?

AmritaCore is a next-generation agent framework designed to simplify the creation and deployment of intelligent agents. Built with modern Python technologies, it provides a comprehensive solution for implementing AI-powered applications with features like event-driven architecture, tool integration, and multi-modal support.

## 🎯 Mission and Value Proposition

The mission of AmritaCore is to democratize the development of intelligent agents by providing a powerful yet accessible framework. Our core value propositions include:

- **Stream-based Design**: All message outputs are designed as asynchronous streams for real-time responses
- **Security**: Built-in cookie security detection to ensure session safety
- **Vendor Agnostic**: Data types and conversation management are independent of specific providers, offering high portability
- **Extensibility**: Integrated MCP client in extension mechanisms for enhanced system scalability

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Every is a Stream**: All message outputs are asynchronous stream-based designs supporting real-time responses
2. **Cookie Security Detection**: Built-in cookie security detection functionality to protect session security
3. **Provider Independent Mechanism**: Data types and conversation management are independent of specific vendors, with high portability
4. **MCP Client Support**: Extension mechanisms integrate MCP clients, enhancing system expansion capabilities
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive event system for flexible and reactive agent behavior
6. **Tool Integration Framework**: Robust system for integrating external tools and services
7. **Advanced Memory Management**: Sophisticated context handling with automatic summarization and token optimization
